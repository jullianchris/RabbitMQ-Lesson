NET Core, emphasizing its importance in microservices architecture for decoupled communication. RabbitMQ is described as a message broker, similar to a post office, facilitating communication between producers and subscribers. The main protocols supported by RabbitMQ are AMQP 0.9.1, STOMP, MQTT, AMQP 1.0, HTTP, and WebSocket.

The demonstration includes setting up RabbitMQ using Docker, creating a .NET Core console application as a producer, and another as a consumer. The producer sends a message to a queue, and the consumer retrieves and processes the message. The RabbitMQ management console is explored, showcasing various metrics and configurations.

********** Producer (Publisher) Application:
A .NET Core console application named RabbitMQProducer is created to act as the producer.
The RabbitMQ .NET client library (RabbitMQ.Client) is added as a NuGet package to the project.
The application creates a ConnectionFactory specifying the URI of the RabbitMQ server, including the hostname and port (default is 5672).
A connection is established using ConnectionFactory.CreateConnection().
A channel (a communication pathway in RabbitMQ) is created using connection.CreateModel().
A queue named "demo_queue" is declared using channel.QueueDeclare(...). This step is essential to ensure both producer and consumer are aware of the queue.
A message is created as an anonymous type and serialized into a byte array using JSON.
The message is published to the queue using channel.BasicPublish(...), specifying the exchange (empty in this case), routing key (the queue name), and the message body.

*********** Consumer Application:
Another .NET Core console application named RabbitMQConsumer is created to act as the consumer.
The RabbitMQ .NET client library is added as a NuGet package to this project as well.
Similar to the producer, a connection is established, a channel is created, and the queue "demo_queue" is declared.
An eventing consumer (EventingBasicConsumer) is created, and the Received event is hooked up to handle incoming messages.
The consumer subscribes to the queue using channel.BasicConsume(...).
When a message is received, it is deserialized from the byte array, and the content is printed to the console.

Exchanges in RabbitMQ play a crucial role in directing messages from producers to consumers. They act as routing mechanisms, determining how messages should be distributed among queues. RabbitMQ supports various types of exchanges, each serving different routing patterns.

Types of Exchanges:

Direct Exchange:

Uses a routing key to determine the destination queue.
Allows for precise routing based on an exact match between the routing key and queue binding.
Topic Exchange:

Similar to direct exchange but allows for pattern matching in the routing key.
Enables more flexible routing based on wildcard patterns.
Header Exchange:

Routes messages based on header attributes rather than routing keys.
Provides fine-grained control over message routing using headers.
Fanout Exchange:

Routes messages to all queues bound to it.
Ignores routing keys and header attributes, broadcasting messages to all connected queues.
Time to Live (TTL) Concept:

Purpose: Specifies the duration a message is considered valid.
Implementation:
Set using the "x-message-ttl" attribute when declaring an exchange or queue.
Defined in milliseconds, indicating the time a message is allowed to live.
Expired messages are removed from the queue, preventing consumers from processing outdated data.
Example:
x-message-ttl: 30000 - Specifies a TTL of 30 seconds for messages.
