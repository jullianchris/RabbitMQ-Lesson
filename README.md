NET Core, emphasizing its importance in microservices architecture for decoupled communication. RabbitMQ is described as a message broker, similar to a post office, facilitating communication between producers and subscribers. The main protocols supported by RabbitMQ are AMQP 0.9.1, STOMP, MQTT, AMQP 1.0, HTTP, and WebSocket.

The demonstration includes setting up RabbitMQ using Docker, creating a .NET Core console application as a producer, and another as a consumer. The producer sends a message to a queue, and the consumer retrieves and processes the message. The RabbitMQ management console is explored, showcasing various metrics and configurations.

********** Producer (Publisher) Application:
A .NET Core console application named RabbitMQProducer is created to act as the producer.
The RabbitMQ .NET client library (RabbitMQ.Client) is added as a NuGet package to the project.
The application creates a ConnectionFactory specifying the URI of the RabbitMQ server, including the hostname and port (default is 5672).
A connection is established using ConnectionFactory.CreateConnection().
A channel (a communication pathway in RabbitMQ) is created using connection.CreateModel().
A queue named "demo_queue" is declared using channel.QueueDeclare(...). This step is essential to ensure both producer and consumer are aware of the queue.
A message is created as an anonymous type and serialized into a byte array using JSON.
The message is published to the queue using channel.BasicPublish(...), specifying the exchange (empty in this case), routing key (the queue name), and the message body.

*********** Consumer Application:
Another .NET Core console application named RabbitMQConsumer is created to act as the consumer.
The RabbitMQ .NET client library is added as a NuGet package to this project as well.
Similar to the producer, a connection is established, a channel is created, and the queue "demo_queue" is declared.
An eventing consumer (EventingBasicConsumer) is created, and the Received event is hooked up to handle incoming messages.
The consumer subscribes to the queue using channel.BasicConsume(...).
When a message is received, it is deserialized from the byte array, and the content is printed to the console.
